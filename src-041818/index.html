                            The power of recursion evidently lies in the possibility of defining an infinite set of objects by a finite statement. In
                            the same manner, an infinite number of computations can be described by a finite recursive program,
                            even if this program contains no explicit repetitions.

                        Most computer programming languages support recursion by allowing a function to call itself within function's code. Some
                        functional programming languages do not define any looping constructs but rely solely on recursion
                        to repeatedly call code. Computability theory proves that these recursive-only languages are Turing
                        complete; they are as computationally powerful as Turing complete imperative languages, meaning they
                        can solve the same kinds of problems as imperative languages even without iterative control structures
                        such as “while” and “for”.

                                The power of recursion evidently lies in the possibility of defining an infinite set of objects by a finite statement. In
                                the same manner, an infinite number of computations can be described by a finite recursive program,
                                even if this program contains no explicit repetitions.

                            Most computer programming languages support recursion by allowing a function to call itself within function's code. Some
                            functional programming languages do not define any looping constructs but rely solely on recursion
                            to repeatedly call code. Computability theory proves that these recursive-only languages are Turing
                            complete; they are as computationally powerful as Turing complete imperative languages, meaning they
                            can solve the same kinds of problems as imperative languages even without iterative control structures
                            such as “while” and “for”.

                            A common computer programming tactic is to divide a problem into sub-problems of the same type as the original, solve those
                            sub-problems, and combine the results. This is often referred to as the divide-and-conquer method;
                            when combined with a lookup table that stores the results of solving sub-problems (to avoid solving
                            them repeatedly and incurring extra computation time)
