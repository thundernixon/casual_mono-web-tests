                        Recursion in computer science is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the
                        same problem (as opposed to iteration). The approach can be applied to many types of problems, and
                        recursion is one of the central ideas of computer science.

                    Most computer programming languages support recursion by allowing a function to call itself within function's code. Some
                    functional programming languages do not define any looping constructs but rely solely on recursion to
                    repeatedly call code. Computability theory proves that these recursive-only languages are Turing complete;
                    they are as computationally powerful as Turing complete imperative languages, meaning they can solve
                    the same kinds of problems as imperative languages even without iterative control structures such as

                    Most computer programming languages support recursion by allowing a function to call itself within function's code. Some
                    functional programming languages do not define any looping constructs but rely solely on recursion to
                    repeatedly call code. Computability theory proves that these recursive-only languages are Turing complete;
                    they are as computationally powerful as Turing complete imperative languages, meaning they can solve
                    the same kinds of problems as imperative languages even without iterative control structures such as
                    “while” and “for”.

                        Recursion in computer science is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the
                        same problem (as opposed to iteration). The approach can be applied to many types of problems, and
                        recursion is one of the central ideas of computer science.

                        "The power of recursion evidently lies in the possibility of defining an infinite set of objects by a finite statement. In
                        the same manner, an infinite number of computations can be described by a finite recursive program,
                        even if this program contains no explicit repetitions."
